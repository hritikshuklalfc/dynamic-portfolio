# Contributing Workflow

Use this workflow to keep commits meaningful and consistent.

## 1) Make small changes in batches

Split work into one clear purpose per commit:

- structure: HTML sections/components
- style: CSS layout/spacing/colors
- behavior: JS interactions/logic
- assets: image optimization/replacement
- docs: README or notes updates

## 2) Commit format

Use short, action-focused commit messages:

- `feat: add projects section layout`
- `style: improve hero spacing on mobile`
- `fix: correct navbar toggle behavior`
- `chore: optimize image asset sizes`
- `docs: add setup and deployment notes`

## 3) Suggested daily flow

1. Pick one small task.
2. Finish it fully.
3. Commit once with a clear message.
4. Repeat for the next task.
5. Push at the end of your session.

## 4) Quality checklist before commit

- Page still loads correctly.
- No console errors.
- Mobile layout is not broken.
- Changed files match the commit message.

## 5) Push

```bash
git push
```
